PirateBox-Responsive
====================

Responsive layout to use with your [PirateBox](http://daviddarts.com/piratebox/).

To install simply replace the respective files(not folders!) from the /www/ and /python_lib/ folders to your /opt/piratebox/ folder.

This layout assumes you have the Kareha forum installed on your PirateBox and has a link in the header pointing to it. If you don't, feel free to comment out line 21 of 'index.html'.
