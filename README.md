PirateBox-Responsive
====================

Responsive layout to use with your [PirateBox](http://daviddarts.com/piratebox/).

To install simply drop the files(not folders!) from the **/www/**, **/python_lib/**, and **/conf/** folders into the corresponding folders on your PirateBox.

This layout assumes you have the Kareha forum installed on your PirateBox and has a link in the header pointing to it. If you don't, feel free to comment out line 19 of 'index.html'.
